/*1.If you're creating a React component, then the function name MUST start with a capital letter.Otherwise, React will treat it as a normal HTML tag and won't render it.

2. File extension is .js – is that an error?
Nope — using .js is completely fine for both regular JavaScript and React component files.However, if you're writing React with JSX syntax (like <div>, <MyComponent />), then it's recommended (but not required) to use .jsx extension for clarity.
